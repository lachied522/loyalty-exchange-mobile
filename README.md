Hi! ðŸ˜Š

This is the codebase for a mobile app I made called Loyalty Exchange (the app is no longer live). User's would provide read access to their credit/debit cards via Open Banking, and we would automatically match spending with the associated stores and credit loyalty points.

Through the frontend (see https://github.com/lachied522/loyalty-platform-web) stores could view their customers' spending, and customise the rewards they wished to offer.

This was my first mobile app and first time using React Native. It uses Supabase for database and authentication and Expo for easy deployment to both App Store and Google Play.
